Welcome! If you're here, chances are you love computers! Well, I do too. They have captivated my interest fully and have become my passion.

Looking for my code? check out the [repository tab](https://github.com/estech321?tab=repositories).

## Main areas of interest in technology
* **Retro Computing**
    * Fascinated by the history of Apple
    * I own a Windows XP PC and a 2006 iMac running macOS Snow Leopard 
    * Aside from the few old computers I have, I also love watching YouTube videos on the topic.
    * I not only like old computers, but all sorts of old tech such as oscilloscopes, word processors, and more.
* **Programming**
    * Mainly in Python, exerimenting with all sorts of things like Pygame, Tkinter, and other basics but hoping to be able to work with SDRs soon.
    * I also know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but not enough to fully build a website without a template of some kind.
    * Since I work with Arduinos fairly often, I am also familiar with Arduino C.
* **Arduino**
    * I have interfaced it with LCD displays, played music through buzzers, read the ambient temperature, [driven a fully-DIY remote-control car](https://github.com/estech321/Arduino-RC-Wired), and more.
    * I will continue to learn more about how to program and interface the Arduino.
    * I hope to build a watch with an OLED screen using Arduno by the end of 2024!
* **Random computer/circuit knowledge**
    * Anywhere from Linux commands to HTTP requests to the file structure of macOS
    * Basic understanding of CPU cycles, op codes, etc.
    * Lots of random nerdy electronics factoids that would be impractical to list here
